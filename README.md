# New project for creating a Wordlist in Powershell from a Word document
All words starting with and containing at least two __CAPITAL__ letters is considered an akronym for the wordlist.
There will be different output options for the WordList, fx. new last page in the current word document or as a csv/excel document.
Akronym meannings stated in `( )` right after the akronym will showed next to akronym in the WorList. 

## Documentation and information will follow

I have a list of designideas and functions that will be added as issues later on.

I'm open for collaboration.
